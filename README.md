I had the privilege of working on a transformative project in which I oversaw the implementation of Power BI for in-depth data analysis of our product sales. The result was a suite of interactive dashboards that not only provided access to key metrics but also enabled advanced customer segmentation and precise forecasting capabilities. These dashboards empowered with the insights needed for informed decision-making, allowing to steer our business in the right direction and drive substantial improvements in overall performance. The work involves crafting data models that not only streamline data integration but also enhance data quality, enabling our teams to work with clean, organized, and actionable information.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) queries have been an integral part of this work. I've leveraged the capabilities of DAX to create sophisticated calculations and custom measures, contributing to more robust and insightful data analysis. These custom measures have proven invaluable in generating actionable insights from complex data sets.

All the csv files here are the data files which you can import into PowerBI and create models from them. The file with PowerBIDesktop file is the one which has all the analytics and interactive dashboards.
With these data files handy, you just need to download and install the latest version of PowerBI Desktop and import these files into the tool.
